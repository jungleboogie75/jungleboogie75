Python, Splunk, and a lot of “let me see what happens if…”

I like digging into logs, tracing edge cases, and turning messy systems into something predictable. Most of my projects start as experiments and slowly turn into structured tools once I understand the problem well enough.

Big on practical solutions, clean workflows, and learning by building.

Currently learning full stack web development with Next JS, building custom Splunk apps, Analytics, and more
